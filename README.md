The Struggle for India's Independence (1857-1946)
India’s struggle for independence was a long and complex journey that spanned nearly a century. It involved numerous revolts, movements, and sacrifices by countless freedom fighters. The period from 1857 to 1946 was marked by rebellions, social reforms, political movements, and negotiations that ultimately led to India's independence in 1947.

1. The First War of Independence (1857-1858)
The Revolt of 1857, also called India’s First War of Independence, was the first large-scale rebellion against British rule.

Causes of the Revolt:
Political Discontent: The British annexed Indian states under the Doctrine of Lapse, angering local rulers.

Economic Exploitation: Heavy taxation and destruction of Indian industries led to widespread poverty.

Social & Religious Factors: British policies interfered with Indian traditions, including the introduction of Western education and laws.

Military Discontent: Indian soldiers (sepoys) were dissatisfied with low wages, racial discrimination, and the use of greased cartridges rumored to contain cow and pig fat.

Key Events:
The revolt started on May 10, 1857, in Meerut when sepoys refused to use greased cartridges.

It quickly spread to Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Jhansi, and Bareilly.

Leaders: Bahadur Shah II (Delhi), Rani Lakshmibai (Jhansi), Tantia Tope (Kanpur), and Nana Sahib.

The British suppressed the revolt by 1858, executing and exiling leaders.

Impact:
The British abolished the Mughal Empire and exiled Bahadur Shah II.

The British Crown took direct control of India, ending East India Company rule.

The Queen’s Proclamation of 1858 promised religious tolerance and administrative reforms.

2. Rise of Nationalism and Formation of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905)
After 1857, Indian nationalism started growing due to economic exploitation, racial discrimination, and Western education.

Formation of the Indian National Congress (INC) – 1885
Founded by A.O. Hume, the INC aimed to give Indians a political voice.

Initially, it followed a moderate approach, demanding reforms from the British.

Key leaders: Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Surendranath Banerjee.

Economic Criticism of British Rule
Dadabhai Naoroji’s "Drain of Wealth" theory (how Britain was exploiting Indian resources).

Increase in poverty, unemployment, and famines due to British policies.

3. Partition of Bengal and the Swadeshi Movement (1905-1911)
In 1905, British Viceroy Lord Curzon partitioned Bengal, claiming it was for administrative ease. However, it was seen as an attempt to divide Hindus and Muslims.

Swadeshi Movement (1905-1911)
Indians boycotted British goods and promoted Indian-made products.

Growth of nationalist newspapers, public protests, and self-reliance movements.

Extremists like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Lala Lajpat Rai emerged.

The British revoked the partition in 1911, but the movement inspired future struggles.

4. Home Rule Movement and World War I (1914-1919)
Home Rule Movement (1916-1917)
Led by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant, this movement demanded self-governance (Swaraj).

Impact of World War I on India
India supported Britain in the war, sending soldiers and resources.

In return, Britain promised reforms but failed to deliver.

Rowlatt Act (1919) and Jallianwala Bagh Massacre
The Rowlatt Act allowed the British to imprison Indians without trial.

On April 13, 1919, General Dyer ordered troops to fire on unarmed protestors in Amritsar’s Jallianwala Bagh, killing hundreds.

This massacre shocked India and led to nationwide protests.

5. Non-Cooperation Movement and Gandhi’s Rise (1920-1922)
Mahatma Gandhi’s Leadership
Gandhi emerged as the main leader of the freedom struggle.

His philosophy: Non-violence (Ahimsa) and Civil Disobedience.

Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)
Indians boycotted British goods, schools, and government jobs.

The movement ended after the Chauri Chaura incident (1922), where a violent clash led to police deaths.

6. Civil Disobedience Movement and Salt March (1930-1934)
Simon Commission (1928) and Nehru Report
Simon Commission (a British committee) ignored Indian leaders, sparking protests.

Nehru Report (1928) demanded Swaraj (complete self-rule).

Salt March (1930)
In March 1930, Gandhi led a 240-mile march to Dandi to protest the British salt tax.

The movement spread nationwide, leading to mass arrests.

Government of India Act (1935)

7. Quit India Movement (1942) and World War II

Quit India Movement (1942)
On August 8, 1942, Gandhi launched "Do or Die" against British rule.

British arrested all major leaders (Gandhi, Nehru, Patel).

The movement was violently suppressed, but it shook British confidence.

8. Indian Independence and Final Struggle (1946-1947)
1946 Elections and Cabinet Mission
INC and Muslim League won elections, but there was conflict over Pakistan’s demand.

Direct Action Day (1946) led to Hindu-Muslim riots in Bengal.

Mountbatten Plan (June 1947)
Lord Mountbatten proposed partitioning India and Pakistan.

Independence was granted on August 15, 1947.

Conclusion
India’s struggle for independence (1857-1946) was marked by wars, political movements, and sacrifices. Millions fought for freedom, unity, and democracy. The final result was independence from British rule in 1947, though it came with the partition of India and Pakistan.
